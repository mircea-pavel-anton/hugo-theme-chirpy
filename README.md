# Chirpy Hugo Theme

A port of the [Chirpy Jekyll Theme]([chirpy-jekyll]) to Hugo made by [geekifan](https://github.com/geekifan/hugo-theme-chirpy).

This is my personal fork which I am using for my website. It fixes a couple of things with the upstream theme, such as:

- giscus comments loading before the DOM is ready, causing them to error out
- the language drop-down selector not respecting `hugo.isMultilingual`

## Credits
